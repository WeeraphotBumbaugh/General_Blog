# solid-system

This project is a simple blog application that utilitizes Jinja and crispyforms for the front-end, and Python, Django, and Sqlite for the back-end.
Users are able to view all current blog posts, but must make their own account in order to add to the posts.
Each user has their own specicifcally viewable drafts, and can only edit or delete their own posts.
